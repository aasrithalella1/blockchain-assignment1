## Reflection

Building this small blockchain gave me a tangible feel for hashing, immutability, and Proof-of-Work (PoW).  
I learned that the hash of a block is not only calculated from its content but also from the previous blockâ€™s hash.  
This design ensures that even a small change in one block invalidates the entire chain, showing immutability.

Employing PoW showed me how secure blockchains are computationally. By requiring hashes with leading zeros,  
miners must perform millions of operations before finding a valid block. Increasing difficulty clearly illustrated  
how security and resource usage scale together.

Overall, this project gave me a deeper understanding of how hashing and PoW guarantee blockchain integrity.
